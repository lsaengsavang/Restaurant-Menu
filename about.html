      <img src="assets/images/about.jpg" />
      <p>
        In her mid-twenties as a struggling mother of a 3-month old puppy,
        Leeann finally overcame laziness and learned to cook to feed herself.
        What started as following Hello Fresh recipes and watching cooking
        TikToks, blossomed a H-Thai-ML restaurant! Leeann was raised in a Lao
        and Thai family, so it was obvious where her inspiration comes from.
        Thank you for supporting us and welcome to the H-Thai-ML family!
